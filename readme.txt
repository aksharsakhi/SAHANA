2. `pyttsx3`: This library is used for text-to-speech (TTS) conversion, which allows your program to speak to you.
   You can install it using pip:
   
   pip install pyttsx3
   

3. Make sure you have a working microphone attached to your computer or device.

After installing the required libraries and ensuring you have a microphone, 
you can run the provided code. Please make sure you save the code in a Python file (e.g., "voice_assistant.py") and then execute it using your Python interpreter.
